Mythoria is an MMORPG based on solid foundations like Tibia, theforgottenserver and OTClientv8, combining much-loved classic concepts into a modern setting and solutions. For me personally, it is also a kind of childhood dream come true.

## ðŸš€ Project description

The world of Mythoria is based on the now iconic Evolutions concept from 2007. You'll find more than 100 expansions and 3 cities, and the world will be expanded in every major patch. There's also room for a beach or a haunted field by Halloween pumpkins.

**Teleports**

Time is money, and everyone should get the most enjoyment out of their adventures. For this reason, we have introduced teleports to all expansions allowing you to move between action locations in no time. Don't waste your time wandering, spend it on specifics.

**Skills and Exp-rate**

We've had enough of servers where levels number in the hundreds of thousands after defeating a group of monsters. Mythoria has been balanced to provide you with smooth, balanced gameplay from low to high levels. You can hone your skills in fighting with white weapons, ranged weapons or magic knowledge on trainers. AFK training is 100% allowed.

**New spells, monsters and items**

We added more than 30 spells, dozens of new monsters and also edited existing items.

**A definite NO to Pay2Win**

The true enjoyment of a game should not depend on the size of your wallet. In the world of Mythoria, any micropayments are only for cosmetic changes and less valuable items, allowing players to emphasize their individuality without affecting gameplay.

**Games should unite and not divide.**

Mythoria combines the world of Tibia with the concept of the Metin2 game, here you can encounter mythical stones falling randomly on the ground of Mythoria from time to time. These stones not only provide large amounts of experience, if you are lucky, valuable items may fall out of them. Be careful, each stone can summon up to 10 monsters at a time to your aid.

**PVP**

PVP on Mythoria pays off and is available from level 30.

**Fishing makes sense.**

In the beach area you will find an NPC fisherman who will not only sell you a fishing rod and worms, but also buy valuable catches from you. As your fishing skills improve, you will catch better fish and valuable items on the hook. Keep in mind, however, that your fishing rod may break if you lack skill!

**Mythoria is for everyone.**

Literally. The game client will be released on Windows, Linux, macOS and Android. This means you can play, trade or train skils anywhere with internet access.

We have nothing against players who like to automate their gameplay. Mythoria can be played by anyone in any way they want. With the removal of AOLs from the game, any player using a bot at the same time risks a painful loss of equipment if attacked by another player. Balance above all else.

**House? First come, first served.**

In the world of Mythoria you will find more than 100 properties ranging from small, modest rooms to large guild houses. You can display valuable items in them and decorate them with furniture. The house will also serve you as a place to escape from attacking players. Using the bed, you can recuperate and also improve your skills through offline training. You can also invite other players to the house.

**A little risk never hurt anyone, right?**

If you feel that your balance in the game is insufficient, you can go to an NPC who will be happy to play dice with you.
